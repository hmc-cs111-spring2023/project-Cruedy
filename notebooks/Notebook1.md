# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

_My critiquer agree with me that my ideas were a little too ambitious. The feedback helped me decide to focus on the design of the language and to make sure it actually was an improvement from using javascript. The feedback made me also realize that I should just make the language focus in on one aspect that javscript is used for. Overall, the feedback helped me hone in my project idea and make it less complicated. I also talked to Prof Wiedermann, and from that talk I was better able to decide what functionality my language should be able to have._

## Description

_I mainly want to get the language to be used to apply an effect that is written in javascript to a video. [This link](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-language.html#:~:text=The%20After%20Effects%20expression%20language,Comp%2C%20Footage%2C%20and%20Camera.) explains why After Effects uses javascript as its language for expressions. I also found [this link](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/scripts.html) that explains that the script uses Adobe ExtendScript which is an extension from javascript. [This page](https://ae-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/overview.html) explains how the extendscript language is used. Reading through these articles has helped me realize that the editor for my DSL could be any editor and then the code could just be loaded into After Effects._

## Questions

_I spent about five hours this week on this project._

_How do you use a language to apply an effect(that is written in javascript) to a video?_

_Does it seem like the ExtendScript language is a DSL itself? If it is a DSL with javascript as its host, is it internal or extenal?_

_How are after effects expressions currently used?_

_Should I view the video as a parameter?_

_The amount of work I did this week was pretty much just as much work I had expected to get done based on the contract._
