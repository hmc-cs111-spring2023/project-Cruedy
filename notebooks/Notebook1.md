# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

### My critiquer agree with me that my ideas were a little too ambitious. The feedback helped me decide to focus on the design of the language and to make sure it actually was an improvement from using javascript. The feedback made me also realize that I should just make the language focus in on one aspect that javscript is used for. Overall, the feedback helped me hone in my project idea and make it less complicated. I also talked to Prof Wiedermann, and from that talk I was better able to decide what functionality my language should be able to have.

## Description

### I mainly want to get the language to be used to apply an effect that is written in javascript to a video. 

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

## How do you use a language to apply an effect(that is written in javascript) to a video?

## How are after effects expressions currently used?

## Should I view the video as a parameter?

## The amount of work I did this week was pretty much just as much work I had expected to get done based on the contract. 

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
