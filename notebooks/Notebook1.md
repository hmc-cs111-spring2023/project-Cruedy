# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

_My critiquer agree with me that my ideas were a little too ambitious. The feedback helped me decide to focus on the design of the language and to make sure it actually was an improvement from using javascript. The feedback made me also realize that I should just make the language focus in on one aspect that javscript is used for. Overall, the feedback helped me hone in my project idea and make it less complicated. I also talked to Prof Wiedermann, and from that talk I was better able to decide what functionality my language should be able to have._

## Description

_I mainly want to get the language to be used to apply an effect that is written in javascript to a video. [This link](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-language.html#:~:text=The%20After%20Effects%20expression%20language,Comp%2C%20Footage%2C%20and%20Camera.) explains why After Effects uses javascript as its language for expressions._

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

_How do you use a language to apply an effect(that is written in javascript) to a video?_

_How are after effects expressions currently used?_

_Should I view the video as a parameter?_

_The amount of work I did this week was pretty much just as much work I had expected to get done based on the contract._
