# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

_From the feedback that I recieved last week, I decided that I would create a language that would output a script file. Script files have the extension .jsx, which means that they are JavaScript Syntax Extension files._

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

## Description
_I created an [example script file](https://github.com/hmc-cs111-spring2023/Artifact-Cruedy/blob/main/wiggle.jsx), but the function that I put in the file wasn't able to run in after effects. The function I wrote in the script file was meant for After Effects, so I had to change what the main goal of this language was. I decided that the best basic script file for this project could just be creating a shape file, so I created a script that would create a shape layer that exist for the entirety of the time that the composition exists._

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
